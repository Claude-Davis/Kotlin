VARIABLES
* declare a valuable with this sequence:   val <filename>: type = <value>
    * the keyword val suggests the variable is "read-only" and cannot be changed
    * the keyword var suggests that the variable can be updated

        fun main() {
            val firstName: String = "Star"   //in this case (for a string), the type would not hve to be specified because of type inference
            val firstName = "Star"

            var weight = 92
        }

        fun main() {
            val <variableName) = readLine()!!  //takes in user input
            print("You entered: $<variableName>")  //output is "You entered: " and the user's input
